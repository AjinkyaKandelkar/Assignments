                            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and
                            lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can
                            be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core
                            set of language elements such as operators, control structures and statements. Core
                            JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional
                            objects; for example:

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a
                                borwser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extension allow an
                                application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
                                clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to
                                running JavaScript on server. For example, server-side extension allow an application to
                                coommunicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
                                another of the application, or perform file manipulation on a server.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
                        <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                            Javascript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type
                            checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax naming conventions and basic
                            control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from Live Script to
                            JavaScript</p>

                        <p>
                            In constrast to Java's complie-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript
                            supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric,
                            Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
                            more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
                            inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
                            supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties
                            of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all
                            variable, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are
                            public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
                            parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

                            You use variables as symbolic names in your application. The names of variables, called
                            identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore(_), or a dollar sign($);
                            subsequent characters can also be digits(0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letter
                            include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and chracters "a" through "z"
                            (lowercase);
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as a` and `u in identifiers. You can also use
                            the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
                            Number_hits temp99, and _name.
                        </p>

                        </header>
                        <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
                        <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>

                        <code>
                        <pre>var x = 42.</pre>
                      </code>

                        <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
                        <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>

                        <code>
                        <pre>x = 42.</pre>
                      </code>

                        <p>Ths always declare a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't
                            use this variant</p>

                        <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
                        <code>
                        <pre>let y = 13.</pre>
                      </code>

                        <p>This syntax can be use to declare a block scope local variable. See variable scope below.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="main-section" id="Variables_scope">
                        <header>Variables scope</header>
                        <p>
                            When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because
                            it is available only to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable
                            within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only with that
                            function.

                            JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable
                            declared within a block is local to function (or global scope) that the block resides
                            within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function
                            (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if
                            statement.
                        </p>

                          }
                  
                          console.log(x); // 5

                            Global variable are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the gloval object
                            is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another
                            window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called
                            phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as
                            parent.phoneNumber.

                        <p>
                            You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant
                            identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore
                            or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
                        </p>

                        <pre>const PI = 3.14;</pre>
                      </code>

                        <p>
                            A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is
                            running. It has to be initialized to a value.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the
                            const keyword is ommited, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same
                            scope. For example:
                        </p>

                        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Six data types that are premitives:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Boolean. true and false</li>
                                    <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is
                                        case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                                    <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                                    <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                                    <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                                    <li>Symbol (new ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and
                                        immutable.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>and Object</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful
                            functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements
                            in a language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and function as
                            procedures that your application can perform.

                            Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional
                            else cluse to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as
                            follows:
                        </p>
                        <code>
                        <pre>
                        if (condition) {
                          statement_1;
                        } else {
                          statement_2;
                        }
                        </pre>
                      </code>
                        <p>
                            condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an
                            explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluares to true, statement_1
                            is executed; otherwise, statement_w is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any
                            statement, including further nested if statements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested
                            insequence, as follows:
                        </p>
                        <code>
                        <pre>
                        if (condition_1) {
                          statement_1;
                        } else if (condition_2) {
                          statement_2;
                        } else if (condition_n) {
                          statement_n;
                        } else {
                          statement_last;
                        }
                        </pre>
                      </code>
                        <p>
                            In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true
                            will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement
                            ({...}). In general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially when
                            nesting if statements:
                        </p>

                            statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                          } else {
                            statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                            statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_true;

                        <p>
                            It is advisable to not use multiple assignments in a conditional expression, because the
                            assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not
                            use the following code:
                        </p>
                        <code>
                        <pre>
                          if (x = y) {
                            /* statements here */
                          }
                        </pre>
                      </code>
                        <p>
                            If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
                            additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:
                        </p>
                        <code>
                        <pre>
                          if ((x = y)) {
                            /* statements here */
                          }
                        </pre>

                        <p>
                            A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to
                            true. A while statement looks as follows:
                        </p>
                        <code>
                        <pre>
                          while (condition)
                            statement
                        </pre>
                      </code>
                        <p>
                            If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes
                            to the statement following the loop.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The condition text occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns
                            true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns
                            false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following while.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To execute multiple statements, use a block statement({...}) to group those statements.
                        </p>
                        <p>Example:</p>
                        <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
                        <code>
                        <pre>
                        var n = 0;
                        var x = 0;
                        while (n < 3) {
                         n++
                         x += n;
                        }
                        </pre>
                      </code>
                        <p>
                            With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds to that value to x. Therefore, x and n
                            take on the following values:
                        <ul>
                            <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                            <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                            <li>After the thrid pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
                        </ul>
                        After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.

                            <li>
                                The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets {}.

                        For example, the following code defines a simple functionnamed square:
                        </p>
                        <code>
                        <pre>
                        function square(number) {
                          return number * number;
                        }
                        </pre>
                      </code>
                        <p>
                            Primitie parameters (such as a number) are passed to functios by balue; the value is padded
                            to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, the change is not
                            reflected globally or in the calling function.
